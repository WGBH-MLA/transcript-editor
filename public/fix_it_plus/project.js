The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a collaboration between public media powerhouse WGBH and the Library of Congress, believes this treasure trove of public television and radio programs should be preserved and made available to the American people. For the past 4 years, we\u0026#39;ve been hard at work, digitizing thousands of broadcast hours from public media\u0026#39;s 60+ year legacy, to provide public access to this rich and colorful history, and preserve it for future generations at the Library of Congress. And now, we need your help to make the content in this deep archive easier to search and find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the AAPB has launched FIX IT+, our own instance of the New York Public Library\u0026#39;s Transcript Editor tool. FIX IT+ users can correct transcripts for any of the historic programs available in the AAPB\u0026#39;s Online Reading Room. Find a program of interest in the archive and help make the program accessible and discoverable by following along the computer-generated transcript, making corrections along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHelp us preserve history for future generations.

To date, over 40,000 hours of television and radio programming contributed by more than 100 public media organizations and archives across the United States have been digitized for long-term preservation and access. The entire collection is available on location at WGBH and the Library of Congress, and more than 18,000 programs are available online at \u003ca href=\"https://americanarchive.org/\"\u003eamericanarchive.org\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eAbout IMLS\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services [IMLS Grant No. LG-71-15-0208-15].
