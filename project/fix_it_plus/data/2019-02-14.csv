Africa and discusses ways that African Americans can support them. He
welcomes guests involved with local organizing in support of the African
liberation struggles. Dinizulu Ceitou of the African Liberation Support
Committee in Boston discusses the military struggles going on in the states
of Portuguese Africa and their connection to inequality in other parts of
the world. South African nationalist and Pan-African Liberation Committee
member Chris Nteta then discusses how these Portuguese African wars reflect
the wider ambitions of black peoples in the region, who are working to
launch similar campaigns in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Namibia (Southwest Africa),
and South Africa. Following these discussions, the film A Luta Continua
explains the military struggle of the Liberation Front of Mozambique
(FRELIMO) against the Portuguese. Produced and narrated by American
activists Robert Van Lierop, it details the relationship of the liberation
to the wider regional and continental demands for self-determination against
minority rule. It notes the complicit roles of foreign governments and
companies in supporting Portugal against the African nationalists. Footage
from the front lines of the struggle helps contextualize FRELIMO?s African
socialist ideology, specifically the role of the military in building the
new nation, a commitment to education, demands for sexual equality, the
introduction of medical aid into the countryside, and the role of culture in
creating a single national identity. Carew then continues his conversations
with is guests, attempting to relate the liberation struggles directly to
the African American experience. Caroline Hunter speaks about the Polaroid
Revolutionary Workers Committee and its actions protesting the company?s
role in South Africa. She notes the importance of American made products in
assisting Portugal and the minority governments and the unequal benefits
companies gain by operating in these segregated societies. The panelists end
with a discussion of the racial and economic logic of European colonialism
and the lessons that African Americans can learn from the liberation
movements. Summary and select metadata for this record was submitted by
Joseph Parrott. Guests Caroline Hunter, Dinizulu Ceitou of Boston's African Liberation Day
Committee and Christopher Nteta of the Pan African Liberation Committee
discuss the liberation struggle in Mozambique with host Topper Carew. Topics
include Frelimo (the African freedom fighters in Mozambique), the influence
of Black American support on the cause, the relationship between
corporations and the seizure of African land, the need for violence to
achieve liberation, the relationship between racism and colonization, and
the need for Black Americans to recognize that the African struggle is their
struggle. Program includes a 30 minute film titled ""The Struggle Continues

cpb-aacip_52-9351cfv6,Battle for the Mountains,"BATTLE FOR THE MOUNTAINS is an hour documentary about Colorado's high
country which will be broadcast on Channel Six Friday, June 26, 1987 at 9pm
and repeated on Sunday, June 28, 1987 at 11:30am. The focus is on the issue
of whether the beauty of the mountains can be preserved when the thrust is
for more economic development. The program ties together all the forces that
are impacting on the high country: the ski industry, housing development,
timber and mining interests, water providers and tourism. Development means
financial gain for the state, corporations and individuals but the
utilization of mountain resources adversely affects wildlife habitat,
wilderness areas, water for recreational activities and destroys the
esthetic value of Colorado's spectacular mountains. The documentary
thoroughly explores a very controversial issue. Through extensive interviews
the clash of opinions between developers, governmental officials,
environmentalist s and local residents illustrates that although money is
precious so is the pristine environment that development invades. There are
no easy answers. To illustrate this complex problem, the documentary
features a proposed ski resort at Quail Mountain, ski development in
Telluride; Two Forks and Aurora's Homestake II water projects and the Cache
la Poudre designation as a Wild and Scenic River. The Forest Service argues
the merits of logging with environmentalists. Although mining is a depressed
industry, residents of Crested Butte and Lake City stand guard to prevent
future mining of their scenic mountains. Tourism is considered the panacea
to shore up Colorado's faltering economy, but the impact of more tourists
and more visitors is destroying nature's delicate balance. Indian Peakd
Wilderness Area is overcrowded and Rocky Mountain National Park with its
seventy years of protective management is having a difficult time preserving
the Park terrain. BATTLE FOR THE MOUNTAIN is a thoughtful presentation of
the dilemma Colorado faces today. Development of the mountain resources may
be the key to Colorado's progress but the mountains are Colorado's priceless
possession and unless protected will be lost for future generations. While
the documentary is packed with information, one of the unusual features is
the beautiful mountain scenery that covers the snows of winter, greenness of
summer and golden trees of fall.",http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_52-9351cfv6,http://americanarchive.org/media/cpb-aacip_52-9351cfv6?part=1,http://americanarchive.org.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnail/cpb-aacip_52-9351cfv6.jpg,Rocky Mountain PBS (KRMA),webvtt,cpb-aacip_52-9351cfv6.vtt

inspiration from works of art and using multiple kinds of stitches in one

viewers to design their own pattern, and suggests using 17th century
botanical prints and 18th century printed cotton chintzes from India for
inspiration. Tips that she gives to make this ?big? project a success are
having the upholsterer create a template before one begins, working on linen
twill (as it is very hard-wearing, due to its diagonal weave), and drawing
your design on paper and then transferring it to the linen fabric using
embroidery carbon. Stitches demonstrated in this episode include stem

cpb-aacip_15-09w0w2sd,Prospects of Mankind with Eleanor Roosevelt; 106; Africa: Revolution in Haste,"One of the key leaders in Africa's nationalist movement has implored the
major nations of the world to keep from exploiting the immediate needs of
new African nations in order to involve them in international politics.
Julius Nyerere (en yuh RAY run), guest of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt on her
National Educational Television program ""Prospects of Mankind,"" said that
African nations would rather receive future aid through a multilateral
program of the United Nations than through bilateral agreement with
individual nations. Nyerere, expected to be the first prime minister of his
native Tanganyika, chided western nations for their lack of interest in
Africa. Nyerere said he wished he had a ""few Communists"" in his pocket to
wave. He added that he had none in his country to use for this purpose.
Appearing with Mr. Nyerere were: Ralph Bunche: UN Undersecretary for Special
Political Affairs; Barbara Ward (Lady Jackson), British economist and writer
now residing in Ghana; and Saville Davis, managing editor of The Christian
Science Monitor. Asked whether African nationalists were moving too fast,
Mr. Bunche replied that he knew of no ""absolute criteria"" for when a people
were ready for freedom. ""When people seek freedom, they are always
impatient,"" he added. To Mr. Nyerere, the problem was akin to that of a
theft form one's home. He said that if a man steals his jacket, he does not
ask when the owner would like to have the jacket back. ""It was mine all
along,"" the nationalist leader continued. ""I may not look as smart in it as
you look in it, but it is mine."" Mrs. Roosevelt suggested that the existence
of the United Nations in the form of a World Community has speeded the
timetable for the emerging independence of Tanganyika and its neighbors. Mr.
Bunche agreed that the UN had put a spotlight on colonialism and added the
Atlantic Pact and World War II's fight for freedom as contributing factors.
He said that under the United Nations these new nations can sit as equals
with the major powers. Regarding fears of one-party leadership in the
emerging nations, Mr. Nyerere emphasized that nationalism so joins the
various groups that they form one party. He predicted that his party would
win all 71 seats to be contested in coming elections. Mrs. Ward suggested
that some African nations could be aided in the solution of land problems by
assistance from major countries including Great Britain. She suggested that
European countries could reimburse landowners who want to leave before the
native government comes to power. Mr. Nyerere called this approach absurd.
He said that these landowners should consider themselves citizens of the
emerging nations. ""No one is punishing them,"" he continued. ""They are
quitting."" He felt that no special compensation should go to the Europeans
who forsake their holdings in Africa to leave. Both Mrs. Ward and Mr.
Nyerere emphasized the lack of racial feeling in Ghana and Tanganyika. Mrs.
Ward has resided in Ghana for several years and Mr. Nyerere can point to
strong support from European in his country. The panelist agreed that
American youth should look to opportunities in Africa as they plan their own
careers. It was suggested that American industry and educational
institutions should credit executives and teachers for work in Africa as
part of their seniority and career development. The program was produced for
the National Educational Television and Radio Center by WGBH, Boston and
Brandeis University. (Description adapted from documents in the NET
Microfiche) This is a monthly series of nine one-hour television episodes featuring
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. The former first lady serves as the host and
moderator. On each episode she will be joined by three guests: 1) A key
foreign figure such as a visiting prime minister, a United Nations
representative or a man or woman of prominence representing his country
unofficially. 2) An important American in public life or a person of equal
consequence from the academic world. 3) A distinguished representative from
the press or other mass media who will focus the discussion on the relevant
issues and controversies at stake. On each episode Mrs. Roosevelt and her
guests will discuss a current international problem of major importance in
which the United States is involved. The program is made up as two 29-minute
episodes with a station break between the two portions. ""Prospects of
Mankind"" is a television series designed to provide a wide public with those
facts and opinions important to an understating of the underlying fabric of
current international problems. It derives its inspiration from the ideals
and endeavors of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. On each episode Mrs. Roosevelt
joins three distinguished guests who through their position of authority or
expression of opinion have a significant influence on the denervation or
interpretation of current issues. Saville Davis and Erwin D. Canham, editors
of The Christian Science Monitor, at times assist in moderating the
discussions. These program is produced for National Educational Television
by WGBH-TV in cooperation with Brandeis University. In addition to the
audience of educational stations throughout the country they have been seen
in the key areas of New York and Washington, DC, through the facilities of
the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation.",http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-09w0w2sd,http://americanarchive.org/media/cpb-aacip_15-09w0w2sd?part=1,http://americanarchive.org.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnail/cpb-aacip_15-09w0w2sd.jpg,WGBH,webvtt,cpb-aacip_15-09w0w2sd.vtt

cpb-aacip_15-9639k51g,City Makers; 105; Julian Bond,"Georgia state legislator Julian Bond discusses the life of the black man in
America's southern cities with program host Dr. Kenneth B. Clark. Bond and
Clark cover a wide range of topics, including black attitudes in the South
concerning integration versus those in the North; Atlanta as the South's
more progressive city; Bond's effectiveness as a black lawmaker in a white
legislature along with his role as a community leader among black people;
Bond?s estimation of Georgia Governor Lester Maddox; and Bond's assessment
of his political future. Some highlights of the program follow. The desire
for integration is very much alive among black people in the Southern
cities, says Bond, in contrast to the cynical mood of the black populations
of the North, where large-scale disorders have occurred and the tendency is
toward separatism. An obvious reason for the disparity, according to Bond,
is that the North has the big sprawling slums. Possibly another reason, he
adds, is that while social conditions have remained largely stagnant in the
North in recent years, there have been some ""visible changes"" in the South.
These changes have been superficial for the most part, he emphasizes,. They
include, for example, the abolition of ""Negro"" and ""White"" signs, segregated
lunch counters, and Negro sections on buses. Nevertheless, Bond concludes,
""It seems to me a black person living in the city of Atlanta, Georgia, can
say to himself that in the past 10 years of my life I have seen with my own
eyes my circumstances chance in a way that can only be assumed by me to be
for the better. I may not have lifted my standard of living, it may not mean
my children are getting a better education, my house may be in bad shape,
but I've seen some visible changes."" Bond is asked by Clark what he can hope
to achieve for the black man so long as Maddox is governor. This leads bond
into a description of Maddox, which Clark says is marked by ""Sentimental
compassion"" and which ""transcends the trite racial polarization."" Bond
recalls Maddox's difficult boyhood when, he says, the future governor was
struggling to help support his family and improve himself economically.
Maddox as governor says Bond ""is a peculiar mixture of two strains in
Southern politics, racism and populism. And the populism sometimes is
dominant- and when it is, he's rather a decent man."" Of Bond's own political
goal, he says: ""I think I'd like to be in the Congress and that's about as
high as I expect to go - the United States Congress."" Bond, 28, though a
state lawmaker, has been a nationally-known political figure since the
controversy that surrounded his election to the Georgia House of
Representatives in 1965. The house, at that time, refused to let Bond take
his seat because of his outspoken condemnation of America's involvement in
Vietnam. Eventually, Bond was seated with the aid of a U.S. Supreme Court
Order. Today, Bond is one of the best-known spokesmen for the so-called ""new
politics"" faction of the Democratic Party. At last summer's party convention
in Chicago he was entered for the Vice-Presidential Candidacy, although Bond
Concedes on this program that this effort was little more than a tactical
maneuver by the anti-Humphrey forces. Bond is also one of the Nation's
best-known Negro politicians, representing an Atlanta constituency that is
mostly black. A Former officer of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) which, under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael,
spearheaded the black power movement, Bond nevertheless is not generally
considered to be in the same camp with Northern ""militants."" City Makers is

about planet heating and how it is getting hotter and hotter. He wants to

science to convince older and less educated people that climate change was
not true. Says that outside of the U.S. there is little to no debate on
climate change. He talks about the U.S. pulled out of Kyoto Accord when Bush
took office because they did not see it as fair to first world countries.
His dad originally signed the agreement. Believes the time is right to try

cpb-aacip_15-4q7qn5zc65,French Chef; Bouillabaisse A La Marseillaise; 201; French Chef: Bouillabaisse A La Marseillaise,"Episode opens in a Marseille fish market, showing a woman selling fish that
are overflowing the tables. Julia Child explains she?ll be making
bouillabaisse, a kind of Provencal fish chowder. Child proceeds to behead a
fish before the credits have finished and then moves on to descriptions of
the fish market in Marseille. She emphasizes the work of local fishermen and
their families, mentioning in passing that a modern port has been built
right next to the old port and fish market she?s describing. The episode
returns to the studio, where Child demonstrates how to make bouillabaisse.
She begins by sauting leeks, and then shows how to blanche and peel tomatoes
before adding them to the sauted leeks. Then she narrates the herbs she
uses, identifying a few as particular to Mediterranean cooking. There is a
brief digression in which Child describes how to choose a fish for
freshness, this includes another scene from Marseille?s fish market and
examples of several kinds of local fish that Child has in her studio. She
cuts each fish, noting it has to have already been cleaned and had gills
removed. She then chops up a fish ?frame? for a stock. There is a brief
interlude where Child remarks on how fun it is to shop for fish in Marseille
with more scenes of her in the market, and then a return to the studio where
she adds the fish to the broth and demonstrates how it should be served. It
concludes with another market scene, with one of the vendors describing her
recipe for Bouillabasse. Summary and select metadata for this record was

cpb-aacip_15-pz51g0j634,French Chef; Lasagne a la Francaise; 208; French Chef: Lasagne a la Francaise,"Opens with Child exclaiming that lasagna makes a good dish for company. She
then describes lasagna noodles, boils them, and adds olive oil and salt. She
makes a point of noting that she is following the box?s instructions since
she is not an Italian chef. Child then makes a tomato sauce with onions,
fresh and canned tomatoes, and Italian seasoning as well as salt, pepper,
noting that this is a ?peasant dish? so she doesn?t need to chop it
carefully. This segment has a discussion of difference between peasant,
bourgeois and haute cuisine as well as a demonstration of how to blanche,
peel, seed, juice and slice tomatoes as well as what sort of canned tomatoes
to use. Child used ?Italian seasoning? but doesn?t explain what it is in it.
She explains noodles should be cooked to ?al dente.? She encourages viewers
to use leftovers in their lasagna (such as cooked chicken, spinach or
poached egg). She then prepares an ?inner sauce? consisting of a white sauce
with chicken stock, wine, and onions in it. She adds garlic to the tomato
sauce (acknowledging that she forgot it earlier). She assembles the lasagna
with a little oil in bottom of dish, then noodles, white sauce, filling
(spinach in first layer) then (approx. 17:30-17:50) she acknowledges she has
no sense of how Italians assemble it, adds cottage cheese, mushrooms,
chicken, more sauce and begins layering again. Pours more white sauce and
then tomato sauce and more cheese over top. Finally, she demonstrates how to
serve it Summary and select metadata for this record was submitted by Tracey
Deutsch. A great way to use yesterday?s roast, be it poultry, veal or pork. Julia?s
French lasagne is a delicious concoction of pasta, Italian tomato sauce,
saffron threads, dried orange peel, left over turkey, veal or whatever, and

cpb-aacip_15-z892805g61,French Chef; 124; Asparagus from Tip to Butt,"When you prepare asparagus the French way, you have more of it to eat, it
cooks faster, stays greener and tastes fresh from the garden. Delicious
plain or served with a buttery orange sauce for a change, and most unusual
in a soup, custard, or a quiche. The show opens with Child glowing over how much she appreciates asparagus
and giving viewers advice about how to judge, purchase, and store it. Child
emphasizes the importance of preparing asparagus the French way: cutting off
only a small amount of the bottom and especially peeling the
stalk--asserting that it results in using more of the asparagus, makes it
easier to cook and eat, and results in fresher-tasting finished asparagus.
She instructs viewers in how to peel the asparagus (using a French vegetable
peeler), then tie it into bundles and cook it in boiling water. Although she
is clear that it can be served simply with only some lemon juice and salt to
flavor it, she prepares a sauce maltese, which consists of hollandaise sauce
with orange flavoring. She demonstrates how to beat eggs yolks, juice and
other ingredients over heat until they become a custard, then adds melted
butter orange flavoring. She describes serving and preparation for asparagus
that is to be served cold as well as warm. Finally, she demonstrates how it
can be served and eaten. Throughout the episode, and especially in the final
scenes, Child stresses the exceptional taste of asparagus, the benefits of
cooking it as the French do, and her intense enjoyment of it. She points out
that people might eat asparagus every day when it is in season, so having a
sauce helps to vary it. She also encourages viewers to serve it on its own
as a first course or as a substitute for a salad course. Finally, she
concludes by leaning back and lowering a whole stalk into her mouth. Summary

side of childbearing and her new book, The Monster Within: The
Hidden Side of Motherhood.Whether it is uncertainty over having a
child, fears of pregnancy and childbirth, or negative thoughts about one's
own children, mixed feelings about motherhood are not just hard to discuss,
they are a powerful social taboo. In her new book, Barbara Almond draws on
her extensive clinical experience to bring this highly troubling issue to
light. In a portrait of the hidden side of contemporary motherhood, she
finds that ambivalence of varying degrees is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet
one that too often causes anxiety, guilt, and depression.Weaving together
case histories with examples from literature and popular culture, Almond
uncovers the roots of ambivalence, tells how it manifests in lives of women
and their children, and describes a spectrum of maternal behavior--from
normal feelings to highly disturbed mothering characterized by blame,
misuse, abuse, even child murder.",http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-6t0gt5fg0z,http://americanarchive.org/media/cpb-aacip_15-6t0gt5fg0z?part=1,http://americanarchive.org.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnail/cpb-aacip_15-6t0gt5fg0z.jpg,WGBH,webvtt,cpb-aacip_15-6t0gt5fg0z.vtt
